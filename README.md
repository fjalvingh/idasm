# Interactive disassembler #

This is a quick and dirty attempt to create an interactive disassembler using Java Swing as the UI so that it is multiplatform.
It currently supports PDP-11 code to be disassembled, but the disassembly engine is separated out so it should be relatively easy
to add other CPU's, using Java as the implementation language for new disassemblers.

This is a work in progress and I'm not sure it will even finish ;)
